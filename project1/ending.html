   You snuggle back into your bed. 
    <br>
   You dream of watching kittens rolling on grassy fields. 
    <br>
   And of slightly familiar faces in strange places.
    <br>
    <br>
   Somewhere in the distance. 
   <br>
   An alarm calls. 
   <br>
   It grows closer. 
   <br>
   <br>
   Until it's with you.
