                    is the act of collecting leftover crops 
                    in the field after harvest. During harvest,
                     there is food that is left or missed often 
                     because it does not meet store standards for 
                     uniformity. In modern times, gleaning is used to
                       provide fresh foods to those in need. 
                       "Dumpster diving", when done for food or 
                       culinary ingredients, is seen as a similar 
                       form of food recovery. Other than food,
                       there are much more forms of gleaning.</p>
