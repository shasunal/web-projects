## Project #1 - HyperText Narrative
***Due 9/15***  
Using HTML and CSS, create a hypertext narrative which reveals something about yourself, or about an experience you’ve had. Think about narrative structures hypertext allows you to create (e.g. branching narrative, looping narrative,) and try to understand how they can best serve the story you are trying to tell. You are allowed to use words and images.

Keep styling to a minimum – don’t go beyond background & foreground colors, and maybe font size – in order to keep your focus on the storytelling and interaction. Use the`<br/>` and `<hr/>` tags, or the entity to control spacing in your piece.

Within this minimal styling, make give some thought to how color, scale, spacing and the relationship between words and images shape the experience of navigating your website. Also consider the other affordances offered by the browser: maybe the HTML page name or address bar are part of your work, or maybe the work requires to be seen in a browser window of a certain size.

### Deliverables
***Due 9/15: Project #1***
* You will turn in a website, hosted on Hunter's SFTP system. Your home page should be called `index.html` and all other pages should be reachable (or not) from it via hyperlinks. 
* In the discussion post, you will link:
    1) A link to the website (eg. `https://film1.hunter.cuny.edu/NET-ID/project1/`)
    2) A link to your code (on github)
    3) Documentation (see documentation notes)
